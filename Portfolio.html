  Originally, this website was supposed to be just a pet project of mine. But a man's gotta market himself in more ways than one, man. So I figured adding a little cirriculum vitae wouldn't hurt. Listen in addition are a few projects I've worked on, but not all. I tried to implement some variety, i.e. not just my coding projects. Cheers.

    Featured Project: AEV
  </h3>
  <img src = "aev1.png">
  <p>
    The second half of my freshman year consisted of me working in a team of four to build an AEV (advanced energy vehicle). The vehicle was powered by an Arduino microcontroller, which spun dual motors, and producing thrust. I was particularly responsible for supervising microcontroller code along with teammate Eric and for the overall design of the vehicle (drafted in Solidworks). As you can probably tell, the team and I went for something lightweight and minimalistic, but with big propellers, thus big power.

    Featured Project: Future Hendrix

  <p>
    Oh, what a time to be alive. Making a battlestar gallactica-like video game based on popular Atlanta Rapper Future wasn't exactly the first thing I'd think to do to flex my programming chops, but it's different. My friends like it too. A 1.0.0 version will be available for download once my colleague and I finish testing the beta - particularly optimizing the game clock and making the start menu look pretty. Source code will be updated incrementally on my github. Be sure to check the software section to download.

    Featured Project: Cyber Security      Presentation
  </h3>
  <img src = "essenceofcyber.jpg">
  <p>
   I've been a cyber-security advocate ever since I fell for a phishing attempt on Xbox Live in seventh grade, i.e., don't make the same mistake I did. I lead a team of four in a sophomore year presentation about the matter. We get somewhat technical in discussing prevention techniques, but its genuinely an incredibly easy read.

     Featured Work In Progress: Tag Cloud Generator         
  </h3>     
  <img src = "TagCloudSource.png">
  <p>
     Did this for a little fun. Yet another Java applet, the tag cloud generator is essentially done in the alpha stage sense; you can expect a cloud of words in different fonts depending on their occurence in a given text file. I even went and alphabetized them. However, the actual tag cloud isn't styled, and Times New Roman and black font are really never fit for a final product. I'll spend a little while perfecting this. Since it's not done, pictured is some source code from the project, sue me.
