      I discovered I had a thing for music when I was three years old. You could say it was my first endeavor. I studied it consistently until I graduated high school. In that time, I learned piano, guitar, drums, horn, trumpet, and some others. I also wrote music in my latter years. Here's a sample of what I've got.

     I enjoy making beats. Preferably trancy, floaty, dreamy, trippy, the like. Here's one that I made my senior year of HS. I don't give it enough credit.

      I also produce orchestral movie scores with the help of the Ediral Orchestra VST. Because why not.

      Finally, I'm learning to sing. This is really my most recent project. I wanted to combine an EDM feel, with some  trap thrown in. I'm still looking to remaster this and re-release.
