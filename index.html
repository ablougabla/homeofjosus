            Welcome to my page. Whether you have found your way here through happenstance or by intention, go on ahead and look around. This homepage was made by me with HTML and CSS and some Jscript. Improvements and additions are due so I encourage you to check periodically over time.

           I currently attend Ohio State University and, driven by my interest in cars, decided to study aerospace engineering in hopes I could become an aerodynamicist. Admittedly, the aerospace field wasn't quite for me and I was probably more interested in the idea of being a rocket scientist than actually being one.

          I'm involved in the school's information systems association organization, which has been a great ticket into chatting with the Fortune 500 brass. My @_CyberAlliance Twitter page will be back up and running soon. It's essentially the offspring of a technical writing class project, but still serves to advocate safe practices in cyber security for both businesses and personal useage. I work two jobs, one currently at Ohio State's department of Mechanical engineering, front desk at the advising office. My second is at a 24/7, on-call IT student technician team. Both are rewarding.

          I spent last summer as a software developer
          for SANDVIK Hyperion and loved it. There was also free coffee. 
          My aspirations are to either end up in the software engineering industry, or work as a computer systems analyst. I work hard everyday to make sure that one of the two will come to fruition.
