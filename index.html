          Welcome to my page. Whether you have found your way here through happenstance or by intention, go on ahead and look around. This homepage was made by me with HTML and CSS. Improvements and additions are due so I encourage you to check periodically over time.

        I am a 20 year old Computer Science and Engineering student at The Ohio State University. I spent the former 17 years of my life studying music, playing sports, doing not much else. I hit a major paradigm shift while I was 18 and long story short, decided I should pick up a book or something. A year later, I found myself 500 miles away from home, living in my first apartment, and going to a great school. What a time to  be alive.

      I currently attend Ohio State University and, driven by my interest in cars, decided to study aerospace engineering in hopes I could become an aerodynamicist. Admittedly, the aerospace field wasn't quite for me and I was probably more interested in the idea of navier stokes, dynamics, and stall rates than the actual practice of it.

      My sophomore year, I switched majors and found refuge in our CSE department, since I was always found around a computer in my growing years. Truthfully, my interest in computers wasn't obvious to me initially, but after discovering that I may have an apptitude for coding my freshman year, I decided to following through. It's thus far been a fruitful choice.

          I am currently involved in the school's information systems association organization, which has been a great ticket into chatting with the Fortune 500 brass. In addition, my @_CyberAlliance twitter page is back up and running. It's essentially the offspring of a technical writing class project, but still serves to advocate safe practices in cyber security for both businesses and personal useage. I work two jobs, one currently at Ohio State's department of Mechanical engineering, front desk at the advising office. My second is at a 24/7, on-call IT student technician team. Both are rewarding. My aspirations are to either end up in the software engineering industry, or work as a computer systems analyst. I work hard everyday to make sure that one of the two will come to fruition.
